# GitHub Actions Automation Bot

This is a Python script that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate an explanation of the code in a file and writes it to a README.md file. The script is intended to be used as a GitHub Actions workflow, triggered by a push to a repository.

## Dependencies

This script requires the following dependencies:

- `openai`
- `requests`

You can install them by running:

```
pip install openai requests
```

## How to Use

To use this script, you need to create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the script. Here's an example workflow:

```yaml
name: Generate README

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  generate-readme:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install openai requests
      - name: Generate README
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          FILENAME: code.py
        run: python generate_readme.py
      - name: Commit changes
        uses: stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action@v4
        with:
          commit_message: Add explanation to README.md
          commit_options: '--no-verify'
          commit_user_name: GitHub Actions
          commit_user_email: actions@github.com
```

This workflow will run the `generate_readme.py` script whenever there's a push to the `main` branch. It will install the required dependencies, set the necessary environment variables, and run the script. Finally, it will commit the changes to the repository.
